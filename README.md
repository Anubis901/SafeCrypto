##### Managing your wallets is not easy. Securing your wallets is even more difficult.

##### Did you think how to secure your wallet ? What happened if you loose your wallets ?

##### Of course the best way to secure your wallets is to memorize your keys or to us a paper wallet.

##### To be honest, it is clearly not practical and not resilient.

##### That's why i developed an offline app to store my wallets.

##### This system is very robust and easy to use. You just need to remember one password to access to all your wallets.

### How does it work

1) Open the app
2) Click on 'Create a new vault'
3) Choose a folder, vaultname and password and save
4) Back to the home page and click on the locker to load your vault, type your password and click on Unlock my vault.
5) You can press the '+' button to add a new wallet.

All your wallets are saved in your vault automatically.

You can choose to save your vault file to a USB stick or on the cloud.

Nobody can access to your vault without your password.

Choose a strong password and you are all set :)

### Security

What happened if someone have access to my vault ?

The vault file is an encrypted file (aes-256-cbc) stored in a base64
If you try to open the file with a text editor, it will be unreadable for human.
To access to your wallet, you need to decrypt your vault using your password.
